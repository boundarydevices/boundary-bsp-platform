= Boundary Devices BSP

To build the BSP, we recommend using a Docker Container so that you can build with
a reproducible and stable build environment. A template dockerfile can be found here:

http://linode.boundarydevices.com/docker/dockerfile_bionic

Otherwise, you’ll need these packages installed:

https://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/2.6/ref-manual/ref-manual.html#required-packages-for-the-build-host

as well as this repo tool that can be installed like this:

[source,console]
$: sudo apt-get install repo

Download the BSP source:

[source,console]
$: mkdir boundary-bsp
$: cd boundary-bsp
$: repo init -u https://github.com/boundarydevices/boundary-bsp-platform
$: repo sync

At the end of the commands you have every metadata you need to start work with.

To start a simple image build:

[source,console]
$: source ./setup-environment build
$: bitbake core-image-minimal

You can use any directory to host your build.

The source code is checked out at `boundary-bsp/sources`.
